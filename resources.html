    <h3>Caulking your home</h3>
    <p><b>About caulking</b></p>
    <p>If you are a new log home owner, you may have questions about basic ongoing maintenance for your home. While log homes do require special care and ongoing maintenance, the good news is that you can do much of the maintenance yourself. As logs continue to settle and expand over time, you want to make sure to caulk the cracks on the interior and exterior of your home to preserve its longevity.</p>
    <p><b>Caulk the cracks in your logs</b></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Push the foam filler rope into the cracks in the logs, and cut the end with the utility knife.</li>
      <li>Load the tube of caulk in the caulking gun.</li>
      <li>Squeeze the caulking gun, and apply about half an inch of caulk over the foam filler rope.</li>
      <li>Wet the foam paint brush with water, and paint over the caulk to smooth it and create a seal.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>As time passes, new cracks may develop in your logs. Repeat this process as needed to fill new cracks. See the following video for a demonstration of this process.</p>
