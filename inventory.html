  <h2>Inventory</h2>
    <h3>Carving wood</h3>
    <p>Roberts Lumber is proud to sell Minnesota-grown soft woods for carving. Wood can be cut to size and kiln dried when you order to accommodate almost any project you are working on. We always keep basswood and butternut carving wood in stock. Call to ask about our current supply of other types of wood.</p>
    <h3>Logs</h3>
    <p>Call to ask about the size and types of whole logs we currently have in stock. Our inventory of whole logs is always changing, but if you have a large order to fill for a building project, or if you are looking for something specific, we may be able to help you track it down.</p>
